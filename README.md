A game that works using a random number generator to choose certain scenarios that the player can then choose what to do with. You can fight enemies or run away from them, heal yourself by picking up 
health packs and pick up weapons to do more daage. You win when you find the treasure, meaning that luck is a big part of the game, as whether you win or not depends whether that
scenario gets picked for you.
